# This project has been abandoned

As you might have noticed from the commit history, this project hasn't received the love it requires to keep it in working order. As maintainers have moved on to other projects and/or don't have the time to spend on it anymore, we decided to formally abandon this project. We'll keep it archived in Github so anyone willing to fork it is able to do so. Please note the permissions and limitations of the Apache license (see LICENSE file) when you do. Thanks!

# VisualReview API for Protractor
Provides an API to send screenshots to [VisualReview](https://github.com/xebia/VisualReview) from your [Protractor](https://github.com/angular/protractor) tests. See [the example](example-project/README.md) for a quick demo.

## Requirements
Requires Protractor 1.4.0 or higher.

## Getting started
First add visualreview-protractor to your protractor project's dependencies.

```shell
npm install visualreview-protractor --save-dev
```

Then configure visualreview-protractor in your protractor configuration file. Here's an example:

```javascript
const VisualReview = require('visualreview-protractor');
var vr = new VisualReview({
  hostname: 'localhost',
  port: 7000,
  scheme: 'https', //(optional: http|https, http is used if not specified)
  strictSSL: true //(optional: true|false, disable ssl certificate check, true if not specified)
});

exports.config = {

  [..],

  /*
      Both .initRun and .cleanup return a q-style promise. If you have some
      other things happening in before- and afterLaunch, be sure to
      return these promise objects.
  */
  beforeLaunch: function () {
      // Creates a new run under project name 'myProject', suite 'mySuite'.
      // Since VisualReview version 0.1.1, projects and suites are created on the fly.
      return vr.initRun('myProject', 'mySuite');

      // Additionally you can provide the branchName this run has been initiated on.
      // This defaults to "master". Uses this to create a baseline for a specific feature branch
      // Note that this feature requires VisualReview server version 0.1.5 or higher.
      // For example:
      // return vr.initRun('myProject', 'mySuite', 'my-feature-branch');
  },

  afterLaunch: function (exitCode) {
      // finalizes the run, cleans up temporary files
      return vr.cleanup(exitCode);
  },

  params: {
      visualreview: vr // provides API to your tests
  }
}
```

Now you can use the visualreview-protractor API in your tests. For example:

```javascript
var vr = browser.params.visualreview;
describe('angularjs homepage', function() {
  it('should open the homepage', function() {
    browser.get('https://docs.angularjs.org');
    vr.takeScreenshot('AngularJS-homepage');
  });
});
```

## Config

The VisualReview accepts a config object such as:

```
{
  hostname: 'localhost',
  port: 7000
}
```

Other options are:

* disabled, default false, a boolean value whether to disable the actual calls to the VisualReview object.
* propertiesFn, a function with a capabilities argument that is used to uniquely identify a screenshot. For example the following configuration omits the browser version as a screenshot identifying property:

```
propertiesFn: function (capabilities) {
    return {
      'os': capabilities.get('platform'),
      'browser': capabilities.get('browserName')
    };
  }
```

* compareSettings, to define the precision of each pixel comparison. The value '0' will result in a failure whenever a difference has been found. Default '0'. This feature requires VisualReview server version 0.1.5 or higher.

```
compareSettings: {
    precision: 7
}
```
